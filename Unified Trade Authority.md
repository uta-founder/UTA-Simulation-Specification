# Unified Trade Authority

# Summary of the original [Manifesto](https://medium.com/@rossbrodskiy/unified-trade-authority-a-manifesto-for-fair-and-strategic-global-trade-c8bed4b2d494)

**Thesis**
The current global trade system is failing: WTO is gridlocked, ad-hoc alliances are piecemeal, and trade rules don’t adequately address sovereignty, climate, labor, or strategic coercion. Brodskiy proposes the **Unified Trade Authority (UTA)** as a next-generation institution to restore fairness and structure.

**Core Components of UTA**
1. **Governance Structure (Tripartite Council / T3C)**
    - Divides membership into three blocs: Atlantic-Pacific (advanced economies), Strategic South (emerging/developing), and Continental Sovereignty (powers asserting strategic autonomy).
    - Leadership rotates every two years among blocs.
    - Decisions require approval by at least two bloc chairs and a majority within each supporting bloc.
    - An independent Secretariat and expert committees support enforcement, monitoring, and dispute resolution.
    - An **Executive Enforcement Authority (EEA)** channel lets states that significantly invest in enforcement get extra voice (without creating veto power).
2. **Membership Criteria**
    - Economically or strategically significant nations (rough guideline: ~1% of global GDP or regional influence).
    - Must commit to core rules: environmental & labor standards, territorial integrity, data transparency, participation in the tariff-credit system, and harmonized enforcement.
    - Access paths: full membership, associate membership, or transitional status for states that commit to reforms.
3. **Tariff-Credit Enforcement Mechanism**
    - Replace much of traditional import tariffs among members with a credit system.
    - Countries that violate rules (e.g. over-tariffing, currency manipulation) must issue credits to others; those disadvantaged can earn credits.
    - Credits can be redeemed for preferential access, support, or to offset imbalances.
    - Ties trade discipline and compensation into a rules-based, automated mechanism.
4. **Enforcement & Compliance Tools**
    UTA assigns real muscle to its rules, focusing on four high-risk domains:   
    - *Shadow Fleets / Illicit Shipping*: Satellite tracking, AI anomaly detection, port denials, coordinated interdiction, and secondary penalties on insurers/registries.
    - *Commodity Laundering / Origin Fraud*: Mandated digital chain-of-origin certificates, customs cooperation, AI trade analysis, joint inspections, sanctions on facilitators.
    - *Sanctions Evasion Networks*: Integrated trade + financial intelligence, unified sanctions lists, peer enforcement, and coordinated prosecution.
    - *Environmental Dumping & Labor Abuses*: Mandatory reporting and monitoring, trade penalties on violators, rewards (extra credits) for superior compliance, aid to lagging members for upgrading capacity.
5. **Strategic Benefits for Members**
    - Access to a large, stable “premium” trading bloc with lower friction.
    - Protection for sensitive sectors via the credit system rather than blunt tariffs.
    - Faster, credible dispute resolution backed by enforcement.
    - Development funding, infrastructure support, and technical assistance tied to compliance.
    - A framework that aligns trade with sustainability, human rights, security, and resilience.

**Risks, Challenges, & Safeguards**
- Risk of dominance by large powers: mitigated by rotating leadership, bloc voting, and balanced internal weighting.
- Accusations of disguised protectionism: addressed via transparent rules and equal application.
- Burden on developing states: offset via aid, capacity building, and a transitional membership model.
- Technological, surveillance, and enforcement overhead: UTA assumes investment in modern monitoring (satellite, AI) is necessary to make rules credible.
