# Pricing & Market Equilibrium Module

## Purpose & Scope

The Pricing & Market Equilibrium Module is the computational core of the UTA simulation's economic engine. It determines market-clearing prices across all products and countries, ensuring that supply equals demand in every market while respecting budget constraints, zero-profit conditions, and macroeconomic accounting identities. This module transforms the UTA simulation from a partial equilibrium trade model into a fully-fledged Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) system.

**Core Responsibility:** Given production capacities, consumption needs, trade policies, and behavioral rules from all other modules, this module computes the price vector that clears all markets simultaneously.

**Key Outputs:**
- Equilibrium prices for all products in all locations
- Realized quantities produced and consumed
- Factor prices (wages, capital returns)
- Exchange rates and trade balances

## Economic Foundation

### 1. Market Clearing Conditions

For each product p in each country j, the fundamental equilibrium condition is:

```
Supply[j,p] = Demand[j,p]

Where:
Supply[j,p] = Domestic Production[j,p] + Σ[i] Imports[i,j,p]
Demand[j,p] = Domestic Consumption[j,p] + Σ[k] Exports[j,k,p] + Intermediate Use[j,p]
```

**Excess Demand Function:**
```
Z[j,p] = Demand[j,p] - Supply[j,p]

Equilibrium condition: Z[j,p] = 0 for all j, p
```

### 2. Walras' Law

The sum of values of excess demands equals zero (one market clears automatically if all others clear):

```
Σ[j,p] P[j,p] * Z[j,p] = 0

Implication: We can drop one price equation and set it as numeraire (typically P[reference_country, reference_product] = 1)
```

### 3. Zero-Profit Conditions

In perfect competition with constant returns to scale, firms earn zero economic profit:

```
P[j,p] = Σ[i] a[i,j,p] * P[j,i] + w[j] * L[j,p] + r[j] * K[j,p]

Where:
- a[i,j,p] = Input-output coefficient (units of input i per unit of output p in country j)
- w[j] = Wage rate in country j
- L[j,p] = Labor per unit of output p
- r[j] = Capital rental rate in country j
- K[j,p] = Capital per unit of output p
```

**Implication:** Prices are determined by costs, which are themselves prices of inputs.

### 4. Armington Price Linkage

The composite price index (from Demand Module) links bilateral prices:

```
P[j,p] = (Σ[i] α[i,j,p] * P[i,j,p]^(1-σ[p]))^(1/(1-σ[p]))

Where:
- P[j,p] = Armington composite price (price of aggregate good p in country j)
- P[i,j,p] = Delivered price from origin i to destination j for product p
- P[i,j,p] = P[i,p] * (1 + τ[i,j,p]) * (1 + t[i,j,p])
  - P[i,p] = Producer price in country i
  - τ[i,j,p] = Ad valorem tariff rate
  - t[i,j,p] = Iceberg transport cost rate
```

### 5. Factor Market Clearing

Labor and capital markets must clear within each country:

```
Labor Market: Σ[p] L[j,p] * X[j,p] = L_endowment[j]
Capital Market: Σ[p] K[j,p] * X[j,p] = K_endowment[j]

Where:
- X[j,p] = Total production of product p in country j
- L_endowment[j] = Labor supply in country j
- K_endowment[j] = Capital stock in country j
```

### 6. Income-Expenditure Balance

For each country, total income equals total expenditure:

```
Income[j] = w[j] * L_endowment[j] + r[j] * K_endowment[j] + Net_Transfers[j]

Expenditure[j] = Σ[p] P[j,p] * Q[j,p]

Budget Balance: Income[j] = Expenditure[j]
```

### 7. Trade Balance (Closure Rule)

The trade balance can be:
- **Fixed:** Trade deficit/surplus predetermined
- **Flexible:** Exchange rate adjusts to clear
- **Endogenous:** Determined by savings-investment balance

```
Trade Balance[j] = Σ[i,p] (P[j,p] * Exports[j,i,p] - P[i,j,p] * Imports[i,j,p])

Global Consistency: Σ[j] Trade Balance[j] = 0 (world trade balances)
```

## Implementation Specification

### Algorithm Selection

Three approaches, in order of complexity:

#### **MVP Approach: Simple Tâtonnement (Walrasian Adjustment)**

Iterative price adjustment based on excess demand:

```python
P[j,p]^(t+1) = P[j,p]^(t) * (1 + λ * (Z[j,p]^(t) / Q[j,p]^(t)))

Where:
- λ = Adjustment speed parameter (0.1 - 0.3 typical)
- Z[j,p]^(t) = Excess demand at iteration t
- Prices increase when Z > 0 (excess demand), decrease when Z < 0 (excess supply)
```

**Pros:** Simple, intuitive, stable for well-behaved demand
**Cons:** Slow convergence, may not converge with strong complementarities

---

#### **Intermediate Approach: Newton-Raphson with Jacobian**

Solve the system F(P) = 0 where F[j,p] = Z[j,p] using Newton's method:

```python
P^(t+1) = P^(t) - J^(-1) * F(P^(t))

Where:
- J = Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives ∂Z[j,p]/∂P[k,q]
- F(P) = Vector of excess demands
```

**Pros:** Fast quadratic convergence near solution
**Cons:** Requires Jacobian calculation (expensive), can diverge if far from solution

---

#### **Advanced Approach: PATH Solver (Mixed Complementarity Problem)**

Formulate as MCP with complementarity slackness:

```
0 ≤ P[j,p] ⊥ Z[j,p] ≤ 0  (price non-negative, excess demand non-positive)
0 ≤ X[j,p] ⊥ (P[j,p] - MC[j,p]) ≤ 0  (production non-negative, zero profit)
```

**Pros:** Handles corner solutions (zero production), guaranteed convergence
**Cons:** Requires external solver (PATH, GAMS), complex setup

---

### Recommended: Hybrid Tâtonnement + Gauss-Seidel

For UTA simulation, use **Gauss-Seidel decomposition** with **damped tâtonnement**:

1. **Decompose** into subproblems: Solve for each country's production given others' prices
2. **Iterate** through countries updating production and prices
3. **Damp** price adjustments to ensure stability
4. **Check convergence** across all markets

```python
def initialize_prices(world_state):
    """
    Initialize prices as marginal costs plus markup

    Cold start: Use cost-based pricing
    """
    prices = {}

## Calibration Requirements

### Required Data Sources

1. **Input-Output Coefficients (a[i,j,p]):**
   - Source: WIOD, OECD ICIO
   - Method: Derive from MRIO tables (intermediate use / gross output)

2. **Factor Productivity:**
   - Labor: OECD Productivity Statistics, ILO
   - Capital: Penn World Tables (capital stocks)

3. **Initial Prices:**
   - If available: Actual producer prices from statistical agencies
   - Otherwise: Set all prices = 1.0 (numeraire) and calibrate shares

4. **Baseline Trade Flows:**
   - Source: UN Comtrade, WIOD
   - Use to validate that equilibrium replicates observed flows

### Calibration Procedure

**Step 1: Calibrate Input-Output Structure**
```python
# From MRIO table
intermediate_use[j][p][i] = MRIO_intermediate[j][p][i]  # Value
gross_output[j][p] = MRIO_output[j][p]  # Total production value

# Calculate coefficient
io_coefficient[j][p][i] = intermediate_use[j][p][i] / gross_output[j][p]
```

**Step 2: Calibrate Factor Shares**
```python
# Value added = Gross Output - Intermediate Inputs
value_added[j][p] = gross_output[j][p] - sum(intermediate_use[j][p])

# Labor share (from national accounts)
labor_share[j][p] = compensation_employees[j][p] / value_added[j][p]
capital_share[j][p] = 1 - labor_share[j][p]

# Implied factor productivities
labor_productivity[j][p] = labor_share[j][p] * gross_output[j][p] / employment[j][p]
capital_intensity[j][p] = capital_share[j][p] * gross_output[j][p] / capital_stock[j]
```

**Step 3: Solve for Baseline Equilibrium**
- Use observed quantities as initial guess
- Solve for prices that rationalize observed flows
- Adjust parameters if model cannot replicate baseline

   - Tolerance: ±0.001% of world GDP

6. **Baseline Replication:**
   - Check: Model replicates observed trade flows
   - Metric: R² > 0.95 for predicted vs actual trade

## Strategic Gameplay

### Player-Facing Elements

1. **Price Signals:**
   - Display equilibrium prices for all products
   - Highlight price changes from previous period
   - Show price gaps between markets (arbitrage opportunities)

2. **Profitability Analysis:**
   - Show P[j,p] - MC[j,p] for each product
   - Identify high-margin opportunities
   - Warning when P < MC (unprofitable production)

3. **Market Tightness Indicators:**
   - Excess demand/supply by market
   - Capacity utilization rates
   - Price pressure indices (how fast prices are changing)

4. **Welfare Impacts:**
   - Real GDP changes
   - Consumer welfare (compensating variation)
   - Terms of trade effects

### Strategic Trade-Offs

1. **Price vs Quantity:**
   - Higher production → lower equilibrium price (supply effect)
   - Strategic withholding → higher price but lower volume

2. **Subsidy Pass-Through:**
   - Production subsidy → lower MC → lower equilibrium P
   - Benefits consumers (lower prices) but costs treasury

3. **Tariff Incidence:**
   - Import tariff → higher delivered price P[i,j,p]
   - But equilibrium domestic price P[j,p] may fall (substitution effect)

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Tariff Impact on Equilibrium Prices

**Setup:**
- Two countries: A (exporter), B (importer)
- One product: Steel
- Initial equilibrium: P[A,steel] = 100, P[B,steel] = 105
- Transport cost: 5%
- Initial tariff: 0%

**Baseline:**
```
P[A,B,steel] = P[A,steel] * (1 + 0.05) * (1 + 0.00) = 105
Market clears: Demand[B,steel](105, Y[B]) = Supply[A,steel](100)
```

**Scenario:** Country B imposes 25% tariff

**Step 1: Immediate Price Impact**
```
P[A,B,steel]_new = 100 * 1.05 * 1.25 = 131.25  (delivered price in B)
```

**Step 2: Demand Response**
```
Demand[B,steel] decreases (higher price)
Assume elasticity = -1.5:
ΔQ/Q = -1.5 * (ΔP/P) = -1.5 * (26.25/105) = -0.375  (37.5% decline in demand)
```

**Step 3: Supply Adjustment**
```
Lower demand for exports from A → excess supply in A
P[A,steel] falls to clear domestic market
New equilibrium: P[A,steel] = 85 (15% decline)
```

**Step 4: New Equilibrium**
```
P[A,B,steel] = 85 * 1.05 * 1.25 = 111.56
Demand[B,steel](111.56) = Supply[A,steel](85)  # Market clears
```

**Result:**
- Producer price in A falls from 100 to 85 (-15%)
- Consumer price in B rises from 105 to 111.56 (+6.25%)
- Tariff incidence: 60% borne by producer, 40% by consumer
- Tariff revenue: (111.56 - 85*1.05) * Q_traded

### Example 2: Subsidy Equilibrium Impact

**Setup:**
- Country C produces Steel
- Marginal cost: MC = 100
- Initial equilibrium price: P = 105 (5% markup)
- Market demand elasticity: -2.0

**Scenario:** Country C introduces 20% production subsidy

**Step 1: Effective Marginal Cost**
```
MC_effective = MC * (1 - 0.20) = 80
```

**Step 2: Supply Increase**
```
Lower cost → firms produce more
Supply elasticity = 1.5:
ΔS/S = 1.5 * (ΔMC/MC) = 1.5 * (-20/100) = -0.30  (30% supply increase)
```

**Step 3: Price Adjustment**
```
Excess supply → price falls
Market clears when: Supply(P_new) = Demand(P_new)

Solve:
S_0 * 1.30 = D_0 * (P_new/P_0)^(-2.0)
1.30 = (P_new/105)^(-2.0)
P_new = 105 / (1.30)^0.5 = 92.15
```

**Result:**
- Equilibrium price falls from 105 to 92.15 (-12.2%)
- Quantity increases by 30%
- Consumer surplus increases
- Producer revenue: 92.15 * 1.30 * S_0 = 119.8 * S_0 (but subsidy costs treasury)
- Pass-through rate: 12.2% / 20% = 61% (rest retained as producer surplus)

## Computational Considerations

1. **Jacobian Sparsity:**
   - Most ∂Z[j,p]/∂P[k,q] = 0 (no cross-product effects)
   - Exploit sparsity for faster linear algebra
   - Use sparse matrix libraries (scipy.sparse)

2. **Numerical Stability:**
   - Avoid prices near zero (set minimum price floor)
   - Use logarithmic prices for better numerical behavior: P_log = log(P)
   - Damp large price swings (max 50% change per iteration)

3. **Warm Starting:**
   - Use previous period's prices as initial guess
   - Dramatically reduces iterations (typically 3-10 vs 100-500 cold start)

4. **Convergence Failures:**
   - If oscillating: Reduce adjustment speed λ
   - If diverging: Check for infeasible constraints (e.g., contradictory quotas)
   - If stuck at corner: Use complementarity solver (PATH)

5. **Parallelization:**
   - Country-level subproblems can be solved in parallel (Gauss-Seidel iteration)
   - Trade-off: Synchronization overhead vs computation time

## Extensions and Future Enhancements

1. **Imperfect Competition:**
   - Introduce markups: P[j,p] = MC[j,p] * (1 + μ[j,p])
   - Firm-level differentiation (Dixit-Stiglitz)

2. **Dynamics:**
   - Intertemporal prices (interest rates, savings decisions)
   - Capital accumulation
   - Expectations and forward-looking behavior

3. **Increasing Returns to Scale:**
   - Non-convexities in production
   - Requires different solution methods (integer programming, heuristics)

4. **Uncertainty:**
   - Stochastic shocks to demand/supply
   - Risk premiums in prices
   - Hedging and insurance markets

5. **Financial Integration:**
   - Exchange rates
   - Capital flows and portfolio allocation
   - Sovereign debt and default risk
