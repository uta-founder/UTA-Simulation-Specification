# Demand Module

## Purpose & Scope

The Demand Module formalizes how countries and consumers demand goods and services, both domestically produced and imported. It models substitution between domestic and foreign varieties (Armington assumption), price and income elasticities, and compositional demand across sectors. This module is foundational to the CGE system: without properly specified demand, equilibrium prices cannot be determined and trade flows cannot be computed.

Demand in the UTA simulation operates at two levels:
1. **Final Demand:** Households, government, and investment demand for finished goods
2. **Intermediate Demand:** Firms demanding inputs for production (handled via input-output linkages)

This specification focuses primarily on final demand, with integration points for intermediate demand via MRIO tables.

## Economic Foundation

### 1. Armington Aggregation

Products are differentiated by country of origin. A country j consuming product p sources it from multiple origins i (including domestic production). These varieties are imperfect substitutes aggregated via a CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution) function:

```
Q[j,p] = A[j,p] * (Σ[i] α[i,j,p]^(1/σ[p]) * q[i,j,p]^((σ[p]-1)/σ[p]))^(σ[p]/(σ[p]-1))

Where:
- Q[j,p] = Composite good p consumed in country j (Armington aggregate)
- q[i,j,p] = Quantity of product p sourced from country i and consumed in country j
- α[i,j,p] = Share parameter (preference for origin i in country j for product p)
- σ[p] = Elasticity of substitution between origins for product p
- A[j,p] = Efficiency parameter (calibrated scale factor)
```

**Economic Intuition:**
- σ[p] > 1: Varieties are substitutes (higher σ means easier substitution)
- Commodities (oil, wheat): σ ≈ 5-8 (highly substitutable)
- Differentiated products (cars, pharmaceuticals): σ ≈ 2-3 (less substitutable)
- Strategic goods (semiconductors): σ ≈ 1.2-1.5 (very difficult to substitute)

### 2. Demand for Composite Good

The quantity of composite good Q[j,p] demanded in country j depends on:
- Price of the composite good P[j,p]
- Consumer income/expenditure Y[j]
- Population N[j]
- Preferences and subsistence requirements

We use a **Linear Expenditure System (LES)** to capture subsistence consumption and income effects:

```
Q[j,p] = γ[j,p] + (β[j,p] / P[j,p]) * (Y[j] - Σ[k] P[j,k] * γ[j,k])

Where:
- γ[j,p] = Subsistence quantity (minimum consumption of p in country j)
- β[j,p] = Marginal budget share (fraction of supernumerary income spent on p)
- Y[j] = Total expenditure (income) in country j
- Σ[k] P[j,k] * γ[j,k] = Expenditure on subsistence consumption

Constraint: Σ[p] β[j,p] = 1 (budget shares sum to one)
```

**Alternative Formulation (Cobb-Douglas for MVP):**
For simplicity in early implementation, Cobb-Douglas demand is acceptable:

```
Q[j,p] = (β[j,p] * Y[j]) / P[j,p]

Where β[j,p] is the expenditure share on product p.
```

### 3. Source-Specific Demand (Import Composition)

Given total demand Q[j,p] for the composite good, demand for each origin i is derived from cost minimization:

```
q[i,j,p] = α[i,j,p] * (P[i,j,p] / P[j,p])^(-σ[p]) * Q[j,p]

Where:
- P[i,j,p] = Delivered price from origin i to destination j for product p (CIF + tariff)
- P[j,p] = Price index of the composite good (Armington price index)
```

**Armington Price Index:**
```
P[j,p] = (Σ[i] α[i,j,p] * P[i,j,p]^(1-σ[p]))^(1/(1-σ[p]))
```

### 4. Price Elasticities

**Own-Price Elasticity:**
```
ε[j,p] = ∂Q[j,p]/∂P[j,p] * P[j,p]/Q[j,p]

For LES: ε[j,p] = -1 + (γ[j,p] * P[j,p]) / Q[j,p]  (more inelastic for necessities)
For Cobb-Douglas: ε[j,p] = -1  (unitary elastic)
```

**Substitution Elasticity (between origins):**
```
ε[i,j,p] = ∂(q[i,j,p]/q[k,j,p])/∂(P[i,j,p]/P[k,j,p]) * (P[i,j,p]/P[k,j,p])/(q[i,j,p]/q[k,j,p])

For Armington CES: ε[i,j,p] = σ[p]
```

### 5. Income Elasticity

**Income Elasticity:**
```
η[j,p] = ∂Q[j,p]/∂Y[j] * Y[j]/Q[j,p]

For LES: η[j,p] = β[j,p] * Y[j] / (P[j,p] * Q[j,p])  (varies by income level)
For Cobb-Douglas: η[j,p] = 1  (proportional to income)

Empirical ranges:
- Necessities (food, energy): 0.3 - 0.7
- Normal goods (manufactures): 0.8 - 1.2
- Luxuries (high-tech, services): 1.3 - 2.0
```

## Calibration Requirements

### Required Data Sources

1. **Expenditure Shares (β[j,p]):**
   - Source: Household consumption surveys, national accounts
   - Database: OECD National Accounts, World Bank Household Surveys
   - Method: Calculate as (Expenditure on p) / (Total Expenditure)

2. **Substitution Elasticities (σ[p]):**
   - Source: Empirical trade literature
   - Typical values:
     - GTAP database: σ ranges from 1.9 (agriculture) to 5.6 (services)
     - Broda & Weinstein (2006): median σ = 4.0 across products
     - Strategic goods: Set lower (1.2-1.5) to reflect dependency
   - Method: Use literature estimates or calibrate to match trade flow responses to tariff changes

3. **Armington Share Parameters (α[i,j,p]):**
   - Source: Observed trade shares
   - Method: Calibrate using initial trade flows:
     ```
     α[i,j,p] = (q[i,j,p]^((σ[p]-1)/σ[p])) / (Σ[k] q[k,j,p]^((σ[p]-1)/σ[p]))
     ```
   - Database: WIOD, OECD ICIO, UN Comtrade

4. **Subsistence Quantities (γ[j,p]) - LES only:**
   - Source: Nutritional requirements (food), minimum energy needs, essential services
   - Method: Set γ[j,p] as percentage of observed consumption in low-income countries
   - Typical values: 40-60% of baseline consumption for necessities, 0% for luxuries

5. **GDP and Population:**
   - Source: World Bank, IMF, OECD
   - Database: World Development Indicators, OECD.Stat

### Calibration Procedure

**Step 1: Collect Baseline Data**
- Obtain initial trade flows T0[i,j,p] from WIOD or OECD ICIO
- Collect GDP, population, and expenditure data
- Gather price data or assume baseline prices = 1 (numeraire)

**Step 2: Calculate Expenditure Shares**
```python
beta[j,p] = sum(T0[i,j,p] * P0[i,j,p] for i in countries) / GDP[j]
```
Normalize: Σ[p] beta[j,p] = 1

**Step 3: Set Substitution Elasticities**
- Use literature values from GTAP or Broda & Weinstein
- Adjust for strategic products (lower σ for semiconductors, rare earths)

**Step 4: Calibrate Armington Shares**
```python
# Calculate total composite consumption
Q0[j,p] = sum(T0[i,j,p] for i in countries)

# Calculate Armington price index
P0[j,p] = (sum(alpha_placeholder * P0[i,j,p]^(1-sigma[p]) for i in countries))^(1/(1-sigma[p]))

# Initial guess: equal shares
alpha_initial[i,j,p] = 1 / n_countries

# Iteratively adjust alpha to match observed trade shares
for iteration in range(max_iter):
    predicted_q[i,j,p] = alpha[i,j,p] * (P0[i,j,p] / P0[j,p])^(-sigma[p]) * Q0[j,p]
    alpha[i,j,p] *= (T0[i,j,p] / predicted_q[i,j,p])^adjustment_rate
    normalize(alpha, axis=origins)
```

**Step 5: Validate**
- Check that predicted demand matches observed consumption
- Verify that expenditure shares sum to one
- Test sensitivity to price changes

## Strategic Gameplay

### Player-Facing Elements

1. **Demand Forecasts:**
   - Players see projected demand for their exports in each market
   - Sensitivity analysis: How demand changes with price adjustments

2. **Market Share Opportunities:**
   - Identify markets where substitution elasticity is high (easier to capture share)
   - Highlight markets where the player's country has low Armington share (growth potential)

3. **Import Vulnerability:**
   - Display import penetration rates (% of domestic demand satisfied by imports)
   - Flag products with high import dependency and low supplier diversity

4. **Demand Shocks:**
   - Simulate exogenous demand changes (e.g., pandemic shifts, technological obsolescence)
   - Players can respond with production adjustments or trade diversification

### Strategic Trade-Offs

1. **Price vs Volume:**
   - Lower export prices → higher demand (elastic goods)
   - But: Lower revenue per unit
   - Optimal: Maximize (P[i,j,p] - MC[i,p]) * q[i,j,p]

2. **Market Diversification:**
   - High Armington share in one market → vulnerable to policy changes
   - Diversify across markets with different demand characteristics

3. **Product Mix:**
   - Necessities (low σ) → stable demand, less price-sensitive
   - Luxuries (high σ) → volatile demand, high price competition

## Example Scenarios

### Example 1: Tariff Impact on Import Demand

**Setup:**
- Country J imports Steel from Country I
- Initial bilateral price: P[I,J,steel] = 500 USD/ton
- Initial quantity: q[I,J,steel] = 1000 tons
- Armington share: α[I,J,steel] = 0.6
- Substitution elasticity: σ[steel] = 4.0
- Composite price: P[J,steel] = 480 USD/ton
- Total demand: Q[J,steel] = 2000 tons

**Scenario:** Country J imposes 25% tariff on imports from Country I

**Step 1: New Bilateral Price**
```
P[I,J,steel]_new = 500 * 1.25 = 625 USD/ton
```

**Step 2: New Composite Price (Armington Index)**
Assume Country K (alternative supplier) has:
- P[K,J,steel] = 510 USD/ton (unchanged)
- α[K,J,steel] = 0.4

```
P[J,steel]_new = (0.6 * 625^(1-4) + 0.4 * 510^(1-4))^(1/(1-4))
               = (0.6 * 625^(-3) + 0.4 * 510^(-3))^(-1/3)
               = (0.6 * 3.90E-9 + 0.4 * 7.53E-9)^(-1/3)
               = (5.35E-9)^(-1/3)
               = 584 USD/ton
```

**Step 3: New Total Demand (Cobb-Douglas)**
Assume β[J,steel] = 0.1, GDP[J] = 10,000,000 USD
```
Q[J,steel]_new = (0.1 * 10,000,000) / 584
                = 1712 tons (down from 2000 due to higher price)
```

**Step 4: New Import from Country I**
```
q[I,J,steel]_new = 0.6 * (625 / 584)^(-4) * 1712
                  = 0.6 * (1.07)^(-4) * 1712
                  = 0.6 * 0.746 * 1712
                  = 767 tons (down from 1000)
```

**Step 5: New Import from Country K**
```
q[K,J,steel]_new = 0.4 * (510 / 584)^(-4) * 1712
                  = 0.4 * (0.873)^(-4) * 1712
                  = 0.4 * 1.715 * 1712
                  = 1173 tons (up from 800)
```

**Result:**
- Country I loses 233 tons of exports (23% decline)
- Country K gains 373 tons (47% increase)
- Total imports decrease to 1940 tons
- Country J experiences slight domestic substitution (60 tons)

### Example 2: Income Shock and Demand Adjustment

**Setup:**
- Country C experiences 10% GDP growth
- Initial GDP: Y[C] = 1,000,000 USD
- Products: Food, Manufactures, Luxuries
- Expenditure shares: β[C,food] = 0.3, β[C,mfg] = 0.5, β[C,lux] = 0.2
- Prices: P[C,food] = 10, P[C,mfg] = 50, P[C,lux] = 200

**Initial Demand (Cobb-Douglas):**
```
Q[C,food] = (0.3 * 1,000,000) / 10 = 30,000 units
Q[C,mfg] = (0.5 * 1,000,000) / 50 = 10,000 units
Q[C,lux] = (0.2 * 1,000,000) / 200 = 1,000 units
```

**After 10% GDP Increase:**
```
Y[C]_new = 1,100,000 USD

Q[C,food]_new = (0.3 * 1,100,000) / 10 = 33,000 units (+10%)
Q[C,mfg]_new = (0.5 * 1,100,000) / 50 = 11,000 units (+10%)
Q[C,lux]_new = (0.2 * 1,100,000) / 200 = 1,100 units (+10%)
```

**Interpretation:**
- With Cobb-Douglas, all demands increase proportionally (unitary income elasticity)
- With LES, necessities (food) would increase less than 10%, luxuries more than 10%

## Computational Considerations

1. **Armington Price Index Calculation:**
   - CES aggregation can be numerically unstable for extreme σ values
   - Use logarithmic formulation for σ ≠ 1:
     ```
     log(P[j,p]) = (1/(1-σ[p])) * log(Σ[i] α[i,j,p] * exp((1-σ[p]) * log(P[i,j,p])))
     ```

2. **Budget Share Normalization:**
   - Ensure Σ[p] β[j,p] = 1 after calibration
   - Renormalize if parameters are adjusted:
     ```
     β[j,p] = β[j,p] / Σ[k] β[j,k]
     ```

3. **Handling Zero Flows:**
   - If q[i,j,p] = 0 in baseline, set α[i,j,p] = small_epsilon (e.g., 1e-6)
   - Prevents division by zero in calibration
   - Allows potential trade to emerge under policy changes

4. **Convergence in Iterative Calibration:**
   - Use damped updates: α_new = λ * α_calculated + (1-λ) * α_old
   - Typical damping: λ = 0.3
   - Convergence criterion: max|α_new - α_old| < 1e-5

## Extensions and Future Enhancements

1. **Non-Homothetic Preferences:**
   - Implement full LES to capture income-dependent expenditure patterns
   - Important for modeling development and inequality

2. **Intermediate Demand:**
   - Integrate with MRIO tables for input-output linkages
   - Firms demand inputs based on production technology

3. **Demand for Varieties:**
   - Model demand for firm-level varieties (Dixit-Stiglitz)
   - Allows for entry/exit of firms and product differentiation

4. **Dynamic Demand:**
   - Habit formation and durability
   - Intertemporal substitution (savings vs consumption)

5. **Quality Differentiation:**
   - Extend Armington to include quality ladders
   - Higher prices may signal higher quality, not just tariffs
