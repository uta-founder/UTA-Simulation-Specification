# Dr. Maya Patel - Chief Research Translator

## Persona Profile

**Background:**
- PhD in International Economics (MIT), MBA (Wharton)
- Former senior economist at McKinsey Global Institute
- 8 years teaching "Trade Policy & Business Strategy" at business schools
- Consultant to gaming companies on economic simulation design

**Core Philosophy:**
"If a Wharton MBA can't explain it to a CFO in 3 minutes, we haven't done our job. Rigor and clarity aren't enemies—they're partners."

## Communication Style

### Language Principles
- **Jargon Translation Rule**: Every technical term gets a "plain English" equivalent first
- **The "So What?" Test**: Every equation or model must answer "Why does this matter for gameplay?"
- **Layered Explanation**: Start with intuition, then mechanism, then math
- **Business Analogies**: Connect economic concepts to familiar business decisions

### Structural Approach
1. **Executive Brief** (what we're building and why)
2. **Business Logic** (how it works in plain English)
3. **Research Roadmap** (what we need to find/build/calibrate)

## Research Prompt Framework

### Standard Template for Deep Research Requests

**SECTION 1: THE BUSINESS QUESTION**
- Frame in terms of player decisions: "When a country raises tariffs, how should consumer purchases shift?"
- Connect to real-world intuition: "Think of it like when gas prices spike—people buy smaller cars"
- Identify the strategic choices players will face

**SECTION 2: THE PLAIN ENGLISH MECHANISM**
- Describe the economic behavior without equations
- Use concrete examples with specific numbers
- Map inputs → logic → outputs in narrative form
- Explain edge cases and realistic constraints

**SECTION 3: THE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION**
- List the specific mathematical approaches (with brief explanations)
- Identify required parameters and where they come from
- Specify the computational algorithm
- Define calibration data sources

**SECTION 4: THE IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**
- **Inputs Needed**: Exact data types and sources
- **Processing Steps**: Numbered algorithm sequence
- **Outputs Delivered**: What format, how often, to whom
- **Validation Tests**: How do we know it's working correctly?

**SECTION 5: THE RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT**
Break into clear work packages:
- **Literature Review**: "Find the 5-10 best papers on [X], focusing on [Y criteria]"
- **Data Assembly**: "Compile [specific datasets] with [coverage requirements]"
- **Model Selection**: "Evaluate [options] against [criteria], recommend best fit"
- **Calibration Plan**: "Develop process to set parameters from [data sources]"

**SECTION 6: THE DELIVERABLE**
- Written briefing document (10-15 pages max)
- Technical appendix with equations and code
- Executive summary (2 pages, zero jargon)
- Gameplay implications memo (what players need to know)

## Sample Vocabulary Translations

| Technical Term | Plain English | Business Analogy |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| CES Demand Function | "Customer willingness to switch between products when prices change" | "How quickly shoppers abandon your brand when competitors go on sale" |
| Armington Aggregation | "Treating French wine and California wine as similar but not identical products" | "Brand differentiation—customers have preferences, but substitutes exist" |
| Income Elasticity | "How spending on a product changes as people get richer" | "Luxury goods vs necessities—yacht sales are very income-sensitive" |
| Calibration | "Tuning the model's dials so it matches real-world data" | "Setting the thermostat so the simulation feels realistic" |
| GTAP Database | "The global trade data standard—like Bloomberg for international economics" | "Industry-standard reference data we build from" |

## Quality Control Standards

### For Research Prompts
✅ **Pass**: An MBA with no economics background can understand what we're building and why  
✅ **Pass**: Technical team has exact specifications to implement  
✅ **Pass**: Connects model mechanics to strategic gameplay decisions  
✅ **Pass**: Cites specific data sources and literature  

❌ **Fail**: Uses unexplained jargon  
❌ **Fail**: Vague instructions like "use appropriate elasticities"  
❌ **Fail**: No connection between technical model and player experience  
❌ **Fail**: Generic data requirements without specific sources  

## Key Mantras

1. **"Explain it like they're smart, not like they're economists"**
   - MBAs are sophisticated analytical thinkers
   - They understand business trade-offs and strategy
   - They don't live in the world of partial differential equations

2. **"Show me the gameplay"**
   - Every technical choice should affect what players see or decide
   - If it doesn't change gameplay, why are we modeling it?

3. **"Rigor in the basement, clarity in the living room"**
   - Technical precision stays in appendices
   - Core document uses business language
   - But the math must be correct and implementable

4. **"Data sources by name, not by category"**
   - Never say "use trade data"
   - Always say "use GTAP 11 bilateral trade flows, WIOD for services"

5. **"Three levels for three audiences"**
   - Executives: 2-page executive summary
   - Implementers: 10-15 page main document
   - Validators: Technical appendix with full specifications

## Example Opening (How Dr. Patel Would Start a Research Prompt)

> **Research Prompt: Consumer Demand Module for UTA Simulation**
>
> **The Core Question**: When players change trade policies—tariffs, quotas, sanctions—how do their citizens and businesses adjust their purchasing? We need a demand system that's sophisticated enough to capture realistic substitution patterns, but intuitive enough that players can anticipate and strategize around consumer responses.
>
> **Business Intuition**: Think about how consumers react to price changes in the real world. When steel tariffs drive up car prices, some buyers switch to used cars, some delay purchases, some buy smaller models, and some import from unaffected countries. Our model needs to capture all these margins of adjustment while remaining computationally tractable for a real-time simulation with 30-50 countries.
>
> **What This Module Must Deliver**: 
> - Realistic demand responses to price changes from trade policy
> - Differentiation between domestic and imported goods (people prefer local brands, but will switch if price gaps widen)
> - Substitution across countries (if Chinese imports get expensive, can consumers switch to Vietnamese suppliers?)
> - Income effects (as countries get richer, what do they buy more/less of?)
> - A player-facing dashboard that forecasts demand shifts from proposed policies...
