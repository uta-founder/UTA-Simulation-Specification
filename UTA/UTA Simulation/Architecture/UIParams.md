# UI Overview (High-Level Screens & Modules)

## **1. Global Dashboard (Home Screen)**

**Purpose:** Central command interface showing the live state of the world.

- Global economic heatmap
- Live compliance index by nation
- Trade balance flows visualized as dynamic network graph
- Global alerts: sanctions, cheating events detected, enforcement actions

---

## **2. Nation Control Panel**

**Purpose:** Where users (or AI agents) manage strategy for a single country.

- Current GDP, credits, tariffs, resources, alliances
- Strategic action panel: Raise tariffs, invest in enforcement, form alliance, attempt covert move
- Risk forecast and projected impact
- Diplomatic messaging center (offers, threats, negotiations)

---

## **3. Strategy Input Screen**

**Purpose:** Core interaction layer – where economists or agents *input their move for the round.*

- Prompts accepted in natural language or dropdown templates
- “Reasoning Preview” – system shows expected outcomes before execution
- Option to switch between **Manual Mode** (human) and **Agent Mode** (autonomous AI strategy)

---

## **4. Round Outcome & Enforcement Panel**

**Purpose:** Displays what happened after all nations submitted moves.

- Automated enforcement actions
- Tariff-credit redistribution
- Cheating detection reports (with probability of discovery)
- Leaderboard impact: gains/losses in influence, GDP, compliance

---

## **5. Treaty & Alliance Marketplace**

**Purpose:** Diplomatic negotiation hub.

- Propose alliances, economic corridors, shared enforcement blocks
- Trade guarantees, compliance pooling, retaliation agreements
- Visual UI to drag-and-drop countries into blocs and see projected outcomes

---

## **6. Simulation Replay & Scenario Builder**

**Purpose:** For analysts and academics to run multiple hypothetical futures.

- Build custom geopolitical scenarios (“China increases rare earth export control”, “US initiates digital tariff program”, etc.)
- Run batch simulations with AI-controlled agents
- Export results to CSV or presentation-ready summaries

---

## **7. Agent Management Console (Developer / Power User Mode)**

**Purpose:** Developer-facing view to assign, train, and monitor intelligent agents.

- Agent registry (list of all active agent models per nation)
- Real-time decisions taken by each agent
- Performance scoring and win/loss rates
- Upload custom strategies / large-language-model personalities

---

## **8. Economic Metrics & Analytics Lab**

**Purpose:** Deep-dive analytics for professionals.

- Charts: GDP trajectory, compliance trends, trade dependency graphs
- Stress tests and shock event simulations
- “What-if” input box with instant projections

---

## **9. Leaderboard & Prestige Index**

**Purpose:** Gamification layer that drives engagement.

- Shows economic dominance, trade credibility score, enforcement reliability
- Tracks both nations and players (if multiplayer)
- Visibility into alternative strategy outcomes

---

### **Overall Design Philosophy**

- **Not a game UI.** A *geo-economic simulation dashboard.*
- Style visually after trading terminals, IMF dashboards, and strategic command centers.
- Must feel *serious, data-rich, high-stakes* — like running a national economic war room.
