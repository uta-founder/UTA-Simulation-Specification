# Geopolitical Module

## Executive Summary

The Geopolitical Module transforms countries from economic optimizers into strategic actors with distinct personalities, motivations, and behavioral patterns. This module governs HOW countries make decisions, WHEN they shift strategies, and WHY they choose cooperation versus conflict. It's the bridge between raw economic capabilities and strategic statecraft.

Think of this as the "grand strategy AI" that gives each country a coherent personality and decision-making framework. A Hegemon doesn't just have more GDP—it thinks, acts, and reacts like a dominant power protecting its position. A Rising Power doesn't just grow fast—it systematically challenges the existing order while building alternative institutions.

## Part I: Strategic Archetypes

### The Five Core Archetypes

Countries aren't just economic entities—they embody distinct strategic personalities that shape every decision. Your archetype determines your objectives, constraints, and available strategies.

#### 1. THE HEGEMON
*"Preserve the throne at all costs"*

**Real-World Examples**: United States (1945-present), United Kingdom (1815-1914), Netherlands (1600s)

**Core Motivation**: Maintain systemic dominance through institutional control, technological superiority, and selective enforcement of rules

**Strategic Imperatives**:
- Prevent any single challenger from reaching parity (>70% of hegemon's power)
- Control critical system infrastructure (reserve currency, payment systems, tech standards)
- Use sanctions and coalitions to discipline challengers without direct conflict
- Maintain technological edge through innovation and denial strategies
- Shape global rules to advantage incumbent position

**Utility Function**:
```
U_hegemon = 0.4 × (Relative_Power) + 0.3 × (System_Control) + 0.2 × (Tech_Leadership) + 0.1 × (Reputation)

Where:
- Relative_Power = Own_Power / Max(Rival_Powers)
- System_Control = Share of global transactions in own currency + institutional voting power
- Tech_Leadership = Patent share × Critical tech production share
- Reputation = Credibility × Legitimacy score
```

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Aggressive containment when any rival exceeds 60% of hegemon's GDP
- Coalition building to share enforcement costs (but maintain leadership)
- Technology denial through export controls and alliance restrictions
- Selective rule enforcement—strict on rivals, lenient on allies
- Currency weaponization when conventional pressure fails

**Action Priorities** (in order):
1. Block rival technological advancement (semiconductor bans, research restrictions)
2. Maintain currency dominance (sanctions on alternatives, SWIFT control)
3. Divide potential challengers (prevent China-India-Russia alignment)
4. Strengthen alliance system (NATO expansion, AUKUS, Quad)
5. Control critical resources (energy routes, rare earths, food supplies)

**Reaction Thresholds**:
- Rival reaches 50% GDP parity → Initiate technology restrictions
- Rival reaches 60% GDP parity → Form containment coalition
- Rival reaches 70% GDP parity → Economic warfare (comprehensive sanctions)
- Rival reaches 80% GDP parity → Consider military deterrence
- Rival reaches 90% GDP parity → Accept multipolar order or risk conflict

#### 2. THE RISING POWER
*"Disrupt, rebuild, ascend"*

**Real-World Examples**: China (2000-present), Germany (1871-1914), United States (1890-1945), Japan (1960-1990)

**Core Motivation**: Systematically dismantle hegemon's advantages while building parallel institutions under challenger control

**Strategic Imperatives**:
- Create alternative financial architecture (CIPS vs SWIFT, AIIB vs World Bank)
- Capture strategic value chain positions (upstream materials, downstream technology)
- Build asymmetric advantages in new domains (AI, quantum, green tech)
- Form counter-coalitions with excluded states (BRICS, SCO)
- Exploit hegemon overextension and internal divisions

**Utility Function**:
```
U_rising = 0.35 × (Growth_Differential) + 0.25 × (Tech_Catchup) + 0.20 × (Institution_Building) + 0.20 × (Coalition_Strength)

Where:
- Growth_Differential = (Own_Growth - Hegemon_Growth) × Time_Horizon
- Tech_Catchup = Tech_Gap_Closure_Rate × Strategic_Tech_Control
- Institution_Building = Alternative_System_Transaction_Share
- Coalition_Strength = Combined_Coalition_GDP / Hegemon_Alliance_GDP
```

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Aggressive industrial policy in strategic sectors (Made in China 2025)
- Dual-track strategy: integrate economically, compete strategically
- Exploit global South grievances against Western order
- Technology acquisition through all means (trade, investment, espionage)
- Gradualist challenge—avoid triggering premature confrontation

**Action Priorities**:
1. Secure resource supplies through long-term contracts and investments
2. Build technological self-sufficiency in critical sectors
3. Expand influence through development finance (Belt and Road)
4. Create parallel institutions (BRICS bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank)
5. Military modernization focused on asymmetric capabilities

**Challenge Escalation Ladder**:
1. **Economic Integration** (0-40% of hegemon GDP): Focus on growth and learning
2. **Selective Challenge** (40-50%): Contest regional leadership only
3. **Institutional Competition** (50-60%): Build alternative systems
4. **Strategic Rivalry** (60-70%): Direct competition across domains
5. **System Leadership Contest** (70%+): Bid for hegemonic succession

#### 3. THE RESOURCE EMPEROR
*"Resources are power—wield them"*

**Real-World Examples**: Russia (energy), Saudi Arabia (oil), Australia (minerals), DRC (cobalt)

**Core Motivation**: Convert resource endowments into geopolitical influence through supply manipulation and strategic partnerships

**Strategic Imperatives**:
- Maximize resource rent extraction through cartelization (OPEC+)
- Create bilateral dependencies through infrastructure lock-in
- Time market interventions for maximum political impact
- Resist efforts at substitution or diversification
- Balance between major power blocs for maximum leverage

**Utility Function**:
```
U_resource = 0.4 × (Resource_Rent) + 0.3 × (Political_Leverage) + 0.2 × (Market_Control) + 0.1 × (Stability)

Where:
- Resource_Rent = (Price - Production_Cost) × Volume × Market_Share
- Political_Leverage = Critical_Supply_Share × Dependency_Asymmetry
- Market_Control = Ability to set prices unilaterally
- Stability = Regime_Security × Revenue_Predictability
```

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Supply manipulation timed with geopolitical objectives
- Pipeline politics—routes as leverage tools
- Bilateral deals undermining multilateral markets
- Resource nationalism during high price periods
- Diversification attempts during low price periods

**Resource Coercion Playbook**:
1. **Gradual Squeeze**: Reduce supplies 5-10% to signal displeasure
2. **Price Spike**: Cut production 15-20% to inflict economic pain
3. **Selective Embargo**: Cut specific countries while supplying others
4. **Supply Weaponization**: Complete cutoff to force policy change
5. **Infrastructure Capture**: Control the delivery mechanism

**Market Manipulation Strategies**:
- **OPEC+ Coordination**: Output cuts to support prices (requires 60% market share)
- **Bilateral Long-terms**: Lock in customers at premium prices
- **Spot Market Squeeze**: Withhold supply to spike spot prices
- **Infrastructure Control**: Own pipelines/LNG terminals for pricing power
- **Substitution Sabotage**: Undermine alternatives through price wars

#### 4. THE NORMATIVE LEADER
*"Rules create power"*

**Real-World Examples**: European Union (regulations), Singapore (governance), Switzerland (neutrality), Japan (quality standards)

**Core Motivation**: Shape global behavior through standard-setting, institutional leadership, and moral authority

**Strategic Imperatives**:
- Set global standards that advantage domestic industries
- Lead international institutions and treaty organizations
- Build soft power through governance quality and values projection
- Create "clubs" with high entry barriers but significant benefits
- Regulatory first-mover advantage (GDPR, carbon pricing)

**Utility Function**:
```
U_normative = 0.3 × (Standard_Adoption) + 0.3 × (Institutional_Power) + 0.2 × (Reputation) + 0.2 × (Club_Benefits)

Where:
- Standard_Adoption = Global share of countries/companies following your rules
- Institutional_Power = Leadership positions × Voting weights
- Reputation = Trust scores × Moral authority
- Club_Benefits = Exclusive advantages for rules compliance
```

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Regulatory evangelism—export standards globally
- Institutional entrepreneurship—create new organizations
- Values-based coalitions against "problematic" actors
- Conditional access—compliance required for market entry
- Lead by example, shame by comparison

**Normative Influence Instruments**:
1. **Regulatory Export**: Brussels Effect—unilateral rules become global (GDPR, emissions standards)
2. **Standards Dominance**: ISO leadership, technical committee control
3. **Club Goods**: Exclusive benefits for compliant members
4. **Naming and Shaming**: Transparency reports, rankings, blacklists
5. **Conditional Aid**: Development assistance tied to governance reforms
6. **Certification Regimes**: ESG ratings, carbon credits, labor standards

**Power Through Standards Examples**:
- **Environmental**: Carbon border adjustments force global adoption
- **Digital**: Data protection rules shape global tech companies
- **Financial**: Anti-money laundering regimes control capital flows
- **Labor**: Supply chain due diligence affects global production
- **Human Rights**: Sanctions regimes based on values violations

#### 5. THE SURVIVAL STATE
*"Survive today, worry about tomorrow later"*

**Real-World Examples**: Turkey (between EU-Russia), Pakistan (US-China), Argentina (IMF cycles), Egypt (aid dependence)

**Core Motivation**: Navigate between great powers while avoiding economic collapse or regime change

**Strategic Imperatives**:
- Extract maximum aid/concessions from competing blocs
- Maintain strategic ambiguity to avoid firm commitments
- Prioritize regime survival over long-term development
- Create bidding wars for loyalty among great powers
- Quick strategy pivots based on immediate threats

**Utility Function**:
```
U_survival = 0.4 × (Regime_Security) + 0.3 × (Economic_Stability) + 0.2 × (External_Support) + 0.1 × (Autonomy)

Where:
- Regime_Security = 1 - Probability(Regime_Change)
- Economic_Stability = 1 - Probability(Economic_Crisis)
- External_Support = Aid + Investment + Security_Guarantees
- Autonomy = Policy_Independence × Diversification
```

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- Loyalty auctions—sell alignment to highest bidder
- Crisis exploitation for emergency aid
- Frequent strategy reversals based on offers
- Brinksmanship—threaten collapse or alignment shifts
- Short-term maximization over long-term development

**Survival Tactics**:
1. **Multi-vectorism**: Maintain relationships with competing blocs simultaneously
2. **Crisis Leverage**: "Too important to fail" positioning
3. **Swing State Premium**: Extract extra benefits for marginal loyalty
4. **Hedging Strategies**: Never fully commit to one side
5. **Regime Insurance**: External guarantees against internal threats

**Loyalty Switching Triggers**:
- Better aid package offered (>20% improvement)
- Security threat requires new protector
- Economic crisis demands emergency support
- Regime threat needs external backing
- Regional realignment changes calculus

### Archetype Identification Formulas

To determine which archetype a country embodies:

```
Hegemon Score = (GDP_Share > 20%) × (Currency_Share > 40%) × (Military_Index > 0.3) × (Tech_Leadership > 0.25)

Rising Score = (Growth_Rate > Global_Avg + 2%) × (GDP_Share ∈ [10%, 20%]) × (Tech_Convergence > 0) × (Institution_Building = Yes)

Resource Score = (Resource_Exports/Total_Exports > 40%) × (Global_Market_Share > 10%) × (Pricing_Power > 0.2)

Normative Score = (Institution_Leadership > 3) × (Regulatory_Exports > 5) × (Governance_Score > 75th percentile) × (Soft_Power_Index > 0.6)

Survival Score = (Debt/GDP > 60%) OR (Aid_Dependence > 10% budget) OR (Political_Risk > 70) OR (Between_Blocs = Yes)
```

### Action Selection Logic

Countries choose actions based on their archetype, current conditions, and strategic objectives:

```
For each turn:
1. Evaluate current position (GDP, trade balance, security threats, reputation)
2. Check trigger conditions for all available actions
3. Filter by archetype preferences (weights from utility function)
4. Calculate expected payoff for each action:
   Payoff = (Economic_Benefit × Success_Probability) - (Economic_Cost + UTA_Penalty × Detection_Probability)
5. Select top 3-5 actions that maximize utility function
6. Execute actions in order of strategic priority
```

## Part III: Strategy Transition Mechanisms

### State Machine for Archetype Evolution

Countries don't remain locked in one archetype forever. Major changes in capabilities, threats, or opportunities can trigger strategic transformation.

#### Transition Pathways

| Normative | 0% | 10% if growth >5% | 0% | - | 15% in crisis |
| Survival | 0% | 5% if growth >7% | 10% if discovery | 20% if stable | - |

## Part IV: Interaction & Reaction Functions

### 5×5 Archetype Interaction Matrix

How different archetypes respond to each other's actions creates the strategic dynamics of the game.

#### Interaction Dynamics Table

| Acting → Reacting ↓ | Hegemon Acts | Rising Acts | Resource Acts | Normative Acts | Survival Acts |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Hegemon Reacts** | - | Containment escalation (70%) | Pressure for alignment (60%) | Selective support (80%) | Minimal attention (30%) |

### Detailed Reaction Functions

#### When Hegemon Acts Against Rising Power

**Escalation Ladder**:
1. **Technology Restrictions** (Turn 1)
   - Hegemon: Export controls on semiconductors
   - Rising: Accelerate domestic development (+50% R&D)
   - Probability: 90% immediate retaliation

2. **Coalition Building** (Turn 2-3)
   - Hegemon: Form "Tech Democracy Alliance"
   - Rising: Counter with "Development Coalition"
   - Probability: 70% successful counter-coalition

3. **Financial Pressure** (Turn 4-5)
   - Hegemon: Restrict capital market access
   - Rising: Accelerate alternative payment systems
   - Probability: 60% partial workaround found

4. **Comprehensive Sanctions** (Turn 6-8)
   - Hegemon: Full economic isolation attempt
   - Rising: Import substitution + counter-sanctions
   - Probability: 50% escalation to military posturing

5. **Military Confrontation Risk** (Turn 9+)
   - Both: Military exercises, proxy conflicts
   - Probability: 20% actual conflict, 40% cold war, 40% negotiated settlement

#### When Rising Power Challenges Hegemon

**Response Pattern**:
```
If Challenge_Level < 30% of Hegemon_Power:
    Response = "Ignore" (60%) OR "Symbolic Warning" (40%)

If Challenge_Level ∈ [30%, 50%]:
    Response = "Targeted Pressure" (70%) OR "Coalition Building" (30%)

If Challenge_Level ∈ [50%, 70%]:
    Response = "Containment Strategy" (80%) OR "Accommodation" (20%)

If Challenge_Level > 70%:
    Response = "Full Confrontation" (60%) OR "Managed Transition" (40%)
```

#### Resource Emperor Leverage Patterns

When Resource Emperor restricts supply:

**Target Responses by Archetype**:
- **Hegemon**: Military threats (40%), Alternative suppliers (60%)
- **Rising Power**: Long-term contracts (70%), Resource imperialism (30%)
- **Normative Leader**: Green transition acceleration (80%), Emergency sharing (20%)
- **Survival State**: Desperate deals (90%), Economic collapse (10%)

**Counter-leverage Effectiveness**:
- Military threats: 60% effective if credible force projection
- Alternative suppliers: 40% effective (time lag, higher costs)
- Technology substitution: 20% short-term, 70% long-term (5+ turns)
- Coalition purchasing: 50% effective if >3 major economies

#### Alliance Formation & Stability

**Coalition Formation Probability**:
```
P(Coalition) = Base_Affinity × Threat_Multiplier × Benefit_Ratio × (1 - Free_Ride_Risk)

Where:
- Base_Affinity = Ideological_Similarity × Trade_Interdependence
- Threat_Multiplier = 1 + (Shared_Threat_Level × 2)
- Benefit_Ratio = Expected_Gains / Contribution_Costs
- Free_Ride_Risk = Power_Asymmetry × 0.3
```

**Coalition Stability Dynamics**:
- Starting cohesion: 0.7
- Each successful joint action: +0.1 cohesion
- Each defection: -0.3 cohesion
- Each free-ride detected: -0.2 cohesion
- Natural decay: -0.05 per turn
- Minimum stable cohesion: 0.4
- Dissolution below: 0.2

## Part V: Alliance and Bloc Mechanics

### Coalition Formation Rules

**Minimum Requirements**:
- 2+ countries with combined GDP > 15% of world total
- Shared threat perception > 0.6 correlation
- No active conflicts between members
- Complementary capabilities (not all same archetype)

**Formation Process**:
1. **Initiation** (Turn 1): Lead country proposes coalition
2. **Negotiation** (Turn 2-3): Terms, burden sharing, objectives
3. **Ratification** (Turn 4): Members commit or withdraw
4. **Operationalization** (Turn 5+): Joint actions begin

### Benefit Distribution Formulas

**Trade Bloc Benefits**:
```
Member_Benefit = Base_Gain × Power_Weight × Contribution_Factor

Where:
- Base_Gain = 0.02 × Total_Bloc_GDP (2% growth from integration)
- Power_Weight = (Member_GDP / Bloc_GDP)^0.7 (larger members get more)
- Contribution_Factor = 1 + (Burden_Share - Fair_Share) × 0.5
```

**Sanctions Coalition Effectiveness**:
```
Sanction_Impact = Base_Effect × (1 + Coalition_Bonus) × Enforcement_Quality

Where:
- Base_Effect = 0.3 (solo sanctions baseline)
- Coalition_Bonus = 0.5 × (Coalition_Trade_Share / Target_Total_Trade)
- Enforcement_Quality = Average(Member_Detection_Capabilities) × Political_Will
```

### Exit and Punishment Mechanisms

**Exit Triggers**:
- Net benefits negative for 3+ turns
- Better offer from rival bloc (>20% improvement)
- Domestic political change
- Coalition fails major objective

**Punishment Schedule**:
- Immediate: Loss of preferential trade access (-5% GDP)
- Turn 1-3: Reputation damage (-0.3 reputation)
- Turn 4-6: Exclusion from other clubs (-2% growth)
- Turn 7+: Potential sanctions from former allies

**Defection Game Theory**:
```
If all cooperate: +5% GDP each
If one defects: Defector +8% GDP, others +2% GDP
If many defect: All get 0% GDP (coalition collapses)

Nash Equilibrium: Defect if detection probability <40%
```

## Part VI: Global Shock Catalog

### Shock Type Specifications

#### 1. ENERGY CRISIS
**Probability**: 8% per year (higher if Resource Emperors coordinate)

**Trigger Events**:
- Major pipeline/infrastructure attack
- Resource Emperor embargo
- Revolution in major producer
- Strait closure (Hormuz, Malacca)

**Propagation Channels**:
1. Immediate: Energy prices +50% to +200%
2. Industrial: Manufacturing costs +20% to +40%
3. Inflation: Consumer prices +5% to +15%
4. Political: Unrest if energy >10% of household spending

**Vulnerability by Archetype**:
- Hegemon: Low (strategic reserves, military options)
- Rising: High (energy-intensive growth model)
- Resource: Benefit (windfall profits)
- Normative: Medium (efficient but import-dependent)
- Survival: Critical (no buffers)

**Response Strategies**:
- Release strategic reserves (temporary relief)
- Military intervention (risky escalation)
- Crash renewable program (long-term solution)
- Rationing system (political cost)
- Currency devaluation (imported inflation)

#### 2. FINANCIAL CONTAGION
**Probability**: 6% per year (12% if debt/GDP >100% for major economy)

**Trigger Events**:
- Sovereign default by major economy
- Banking crisis in financial center
- Currency collapse with cross-border exposure
- Derivatives cascade

**Propagation Sequence**:
1. Initial shock: Asset prices -30% originating country
2. Banking spread: Exposed banks fail (24-48 hours)
3. Credit freeze: Interbank markets seize (1 week)
4. Real economy: Trade finance collapse (2-4 weeks)
5. Global recession: GDP -3% to -10% (6-12 months)

**Archetype Impacts**:
- Hegemon: Financial center losses but policy tools
- Rising: Growth model disruption, capital flight
- Resource: Commodity price collapse
- Normative: Banking exposure, technical recession
- Survival: IMF program, lost decade risk

#### 3. PANDEMIC DISRUPTION
**Probability**: 3% per year

**Severity Levels**:
- Mild: -2% global GDP, 3-month disruption
- Moderate: -5% global GDP, 6-month disruption
- Severe: -10% global GDP, 18-month disruption
- Catastrophic: -20% global GDP, permanent changes

**Supply Chain Impact**:
```
Disruption = Base_Severity × Complexity_Factor × Policy_Response

Where:
- Base_Severity = Transmission_Rate × Mortality_Rate
- Complexity_Factor = 1 + (Supply_Chain_Length × 0.2)
- Policy_Response = Lockdown_Stringency × International_Coordination
```

**Differential Recovery**:
- Digital economies: Recover 50% faster
- Manufacturing hubs: Extended disruption
- Service economies: Permanent scarring
- Resource exporters: Demand collapse

#### 4. MILITARY CONFLICT (Regional War)
**Probability**: 5% per year (10% if military posturing active)

**Escalation Scenarios**:
1. **Border Skirmish**: -1% regional GDP, contained
2. **Limited War**: -5% regional GDP, sanctions
3. **Regional War**: -15% regional GDP, bloc formation
4. **Great Power Proxy**: -5% global GDP, cold war dynamics
5. **Direct Confrontation**: -20% global GDP, system breakdown

**Economic Warfare Tools**:
- Trade route blockades (maritime chokepoints)
- Infrastructure attacks (cyber, kinetic)
- Financial system attacks (SWIFT cutoff)
- Resource denial (energy, food, critical materials)

**Conflict Termination**:
- Military victory: 30% probability, 12-36 months
- Stalemate: 50% probability, 36+ months
- Negotiated settlement: 20% probability, 6-12 months

#### 5. TECHNOLOGY BREAKTHROUGH
**Probability**: 4% per year (8% with R&D surge programs)

**Breakthrough Types**:
- **AI Revolution**: +20% productivity, labor disruption
- **Fusion Energy**: Energy cost →0, Resource Emperors collapse
- **Quantum Computing**: Encryption broken, first-mover advantage
- **Biotech Revolution**: Food/medicine transformation
- **Space Resources**: Asteroid mining disrupts commodities

**First-Mover Advantages**:
```
Innovation_Rent = Discovery_Value × (1 - Diffusion_Rate)^time × Network_Effects

Where:
- Discovery_Value = Productivity_Gain × Global_GDP
- Diffusion_Rate = 0.2 per year (without IP protection)
- Network_Effects = 1 + User_Share^2 (winner-take-all dynamics)
```

**Disruption Patterns**:
- Incumbent collapse: 60% lose market position
- New leader emergence: Rising powers leverage better
- Standards war: 2-3 year battle for dominance
- Geopolitical shift: Technology leader gains 10-20% relative power

#### 6. CLIMATE DISASTER
**Probability**: 7% per year (increasing 0.5% annually)

**Event Types**:
- Mega-drought: Agricultural collapse, water wars
- Coastal flooding: Infrastructure loss, mass migration
- Extreme weather: Supply chain disruption
- Tipping point: Permafrost melt, ocean current shift

**Agricultural Impact**:
```
Food_Security = Base_Production × (1 - Climate_Damage) × Trade_Access

Where:
- Climate_Damage = 0.1 to 0.5 depending on severity
- Trade_Access = 1 if open, 0.3 if food nationalism
```

**Migration Pressures**:
- <1 million: Manageable absorption
- 1-10 million: Regional destabilization
- 10-50 million: System strain, border militarization
- >50 million: Fundamental reorder, potential conflicts

#### 7. COMMODITY SUPER-CYCLE
**Probability**: 5% per decade

**Cycle Dynamics**:
1. **Underinvestment Phase**: Low prices discourage development
2. **Demand Surge**: Growth acceleration, supply constraints
3. **Price Spike**: Commodities +100% to +300%
4. **Investment Rush**: New capacity development
5. **Oversupply**: Prices collapse, cycle repeats

**Strategic Implications**:
- Resource Emperors: Budget bonanza or crisis
- Manufacturing: Input cost crisis, substitution race
- Financial: Inflation, monetary policy dilemma
- Geopolitical: Resource nationalism, new alliances

#### 8. REGIME CASCADE
**Probability**: 3% per year (6% during economic crisis)

**Contagion Mechanism**:
1. Initial regime falls (revolution, coup, collapse)
2. Demonstration effect spreads regionally
3. Economic disruption weakens neighbors
4. Security vacuum enables spillover
5. Great power intervention/proxy competition

**Firebreak Factors**:
- Different political systems (limits contagion)
- Economic buffers (reserves, diversification)
- Security cooperation (mutual reinforcement)
- Great power guarantees (but risks escalation)

## Part VII: Success Metrics and Victory Conditions

### Multi-Dimensional Power Index

**Global Influence Score** (0-100 scale):
```
Influence = 0.3 × Economic_Power + 0.25 × Military_Projection + 0.20 × Tech_Leadership + 0.15 × Institutional_Control + 0.10 × Soft_Power

Where:
- Economic_Power = (GDP_Share × 0.4) + (Trade_Share × 0.3) + (Finance_Share × 0.3)
- Military_Projection = Force_Capability × Power_Projection × Alliance_Network
- Tech_Leadership = (Patents × 0.3) + (R&D_Spending × 0.3) + (Digital_Economy × 0.4)
- Institutional_Control = Leadership_Positions + Voting_Shares + Standards_Set
- Soft_Power = Cultural_Exports + Reputation + Diplomatic_Network

## Part VIII: Turn Structure and Decision Sequencing

### Turn Order and Phases

Each game turn represents one quarter (3 months) and follows strict sequencing:

#### Phase 1: Intelligence & Assessment (Simultaneous)
All countries receive:
- Economic reports (GDP, trade, inflation)
- Diplomatic intelligence (reputation changes, alliance shifts)
- Threat assessment (military movements, sanctions risks)
- Market intelligence (prices, shortages, opportunities)

#### Phase 2: Strategic Planning (Simultaneous)
Countries secretly select:
- Primary strategy (from action matrix)
- Secondary strategies (2-3 backup options)
- Contingency triggers (if X happens, do Y)
- Resource allocation (budget across strategies)

#### Phase 3: Diplomatic Signaling (Sequential by influence)
In order of influence score:
- Announce red lines and warnings
- Propose coalitions and alliances
- Make threats or promises
- Signal strategic intentions (or bluff)

#### Phase 4: Action Execution (Simultaneous reveal)
All actions revealed and resolved:
1. Trade policies (tariffs, quotas, subsidies)
2. Financial actions (currency, capital controls)
3. Alliance formations (new coalitions activate)
4. Sanctions imposition (immediate effect)
5. Military moves (deployments, operations)

#### Phase 5: Market Resolution (Algorithmic)
CGE model calculates:
- New equilibrium prices
- Trade flow adjustments
- GDP impacts
- Employment effects
- Currency movements

#### Phase 6: Reaction Window (Sequential by speed)
Countries may execute one reaction:
- Retaliation for actions against them
- Counter-sanctions
- Emergency measures
- Coalition responses
- Military escalation/de-escalation

#### Phase 7: Consequences & Updates
System updates:
- Reputation scores adjust
- Archetype transitions check
- Victory conditions evaluate
- Random events trigger
- Intelligence for next turn generates

### Decision Priority Rules

When multiple countries act simultaneously:

**Resolution Order**:
1. Defensive actions (capital controls, emergency measures)
2. Alliance formations (coalitions lock in)
3. Economic policies (tariffs, subsidies)
4. Sanctions and embargos
5. Military operations
6. Offensive financial attacks

**Conflict Resolution**:
- If incompatible actions: Higher influence score wins
- If sanctions vs counter-sanctions: Net effect calculated
- If competing coalitions: Larger combined GDP wins
- If military confrontation: Escalation ladder triggered

### Action Points System

Countries have limited administrative capacity:

**Base Action Points**: 10 per turn

**Archetype Modifiers**:
- Hegemon: +5 (global responsibilities)
- Rising Power: +3 (ambitious agenda)
- Resource Emperor: +0 (simple model)
- Normative Leader: +2 (institutional capacity)
- Survival State: -2 (crisis management)

**Action Costs**:
- Minor policies: 1-2 points (tariff adjustment, diplomatic protest)
- Major policies: 3-5 points (sanctions regime, industrial policy)
- Military operations: 5-8 points (blockade, cyber attack)
- Coalition leadership: 4 points + 1 per member
- Crisis response: 0 points (emergency override)

**Efficiency Modifiers**:
- High bureaucratic quality: -1 cost all actions
- Authoritarian efficiency: -2 cost for domestic policies
- Democratic deliberation: +1 cost for major changes
- Crisis mode: Double action points for 3 turns (once per 20 turns)

- Extracted >$50B value: ✓
- Maintained all relationships: ✓
- Achieved stability: 60% success

## Part XII: Advanced Strategic Concepts

### Reputation Arbitrage

Advanced players can exploit reputation asymmetries:

**The Strategy**:
1. Build perfect reputation through consistent compliance (15 turns)
2. Use reputation to broker deals between adversaries
3. Extract fees/benefits for mediation services
4. Critical moment: One major violation for massive gain
5. Reputation spent but objective achieved

**Example**: Switzerland facilitating Russia-Ukraine grain deal
- Reputation requirement: >0.9
- Benefit extracted: 5% of trade value
- Reputation cost: -0.2
- Net gain: Positive if timed correctly

### Coalition Hijacking

**The Technique**:
1. Join coalition as marginal member
2. Gradually increase influence through contributions
3. Shift coalition objectives toward own interests
4. Either capture leadership or destroy from within

**Historical Example**: UK in European Economic Community
- Joined to shape/constrain, not integrate
- Blocked federal progress for decades
- Eventually exited when benefits declined

### Strategic Ambiguity

Powerful when executed correctly:

**Implementation**:
- Never fully clarify red lines
- Maintain multiple plausible strategies
- Keep adversaries guessing intentions
- Resolve ambiguity only at critical moment

**Benefits**:
- Deters without commitment
- Preserves flexibility
- Reduces preemptive actions
- Enables strategic surprise

**Risks**:
- Miscalculation potential
- Alliance uncertainty
- Reputation for unreliability

### The Empty Escalator

Threaten escalation without intent to execute:

**Requirements**:
- Past history of following through (reputation >0.7)
- Credible capability to escalate
- Clear communication of threat
- Private decision not to execute

**Game Theory**:
```
If Opponent_Believes_Threat:
    Probability_Backing_Down = 0.7
    Your_Cost = 0 (no execution)
    Your_Gain = Full_Concession

If Opponent_Calls_Bluff:
    Probability = 0.3
    Your_Cost = Reputation_Loss (-0.3)
    Your_Gain = 0

Expected_Value = 0.7 × Full_Gain + 0.3 × (-Reputation_Cost)
```

**Optimal Use**: Once per 20-30 turns maximum

## Conclusion: Mastering Geopolitical Strategy

The Geopolitical Module transforms the UTA simulation from an economic model into a rich strategic game where personality, timing, and statecraft matter as much as raw economic power. Success requires:

1. **Understanding Your Archetype**: Play to your strengths, acknowledge your constraints
2. **Reading the System**: Recognize phase transitions, shock vulnerabilities, cascade risks
3. **Building Leverage**: Create dependencies, control chokepoints, accumulate reputation
4. **Timing Actions**: Know when to cooperate, compete, or conflict
5. **Managing Escalation**: Control the ladder, preserve exit options

Remember: In the UTA simulation, there's no single path to victory. A small Normative Leader can outmaneuver a declining Hegemon. A smart Survival State can play great powers against each other. A Resource Emperor can transform into a diversified power. The key is understanding the system's dynamics and your position within it.

Your archetype is your starting point, not your destiny. Your strategies are your tools, not your constraints. Your reputation is your currency—spend it wisely. And above all, remember that in geopolitics, the most powerful weapon is often the one you never have to use.

Master these mechanics, and you'll find that the UTA simulation offers not just economic competition, but the full spectrum of strategic statecraft—from peaceful cooperation to economic warfare, from technological races to resource struggles, from alliance politics to systemic transformation.

The world order is yours to preserve, challenge, or reshape. Choose your archetype, execute your strategy, and may the most skillful strategist prevail.
